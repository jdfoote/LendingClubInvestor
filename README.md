This is an incredibly basic script to make loans on Lending Club.

To use it, you will need to get an API key, as well as find your account ID. You pass both of these in the command line, as well as a file location to write a log.

I edited my crontab file to include this info, and to call this script every hour. This allows me to find loans, without ever visiting the LendingClub site.
